# 100 Days of Code - Log

### Day 1 | 4/10/2020

I wrote the HTML structure of the new website, I am going to code it with CSS Grid


### Day 2 | 5/19/2020

Finally, I skipped this bug when using the slick slider in the header...

It was simple but I was hurrying up so I forgot to add its css files!

I learned to write carefully and not to hurry up, specialy if I write a code ^_^
