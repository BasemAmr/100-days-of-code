# 100 Days of Code - Log

### Day 1 | 4/10/2020

I wrote the HTML structure of the new website, I am going to code it with CSS Grid


### Day 2 | 5/10/2020

Finally, I skipped this bug when using the slick slider in the header...

It was simple but I was hurrying up so I forgot to add its css files!

I learned to write carefully and not to hurry up, specialy if I write a code ^_^

### Day 3 | 6/10/2020

I finished the home page HTML structure finally, that home page equal a big landing page, its HTML content is very long, I still have to build 4 pages before I start styling the pages

### Day 4 | 7/10/2020

I spent a half an hour plus time over the required hour for the challenge

Very very annoying problem and until now I can't fix it

I had to let the computer as my brain was overload

I hope to fix it fast
